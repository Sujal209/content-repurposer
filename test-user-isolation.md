# User Isolation Test Plan

## Test: Verify Library User Isolation

### Prerequisites
- Running development server
- Two different user accounts
- Some test content generated for both users

### Test Steps

#### 1. Test API Route Security
```bash
# Without authentication - should return 401
curl -X GET http://localhost:3001/api/history

# With invalid token - should return 401  
curl -X GET http://localhost:3001/api/history -H "Authorization: Bearer invalid_token"
```

#### 2. Test User Content Isolation
1. **Sign in as User A**
   - Go to `/dashboard`
   - Generate some content (3-5 pieces)
   - Go to `/history` - note the content IDs and titles

2. **Sign in as User B** 
   - Go to `/dashboard` 
   - Generate different content (3-5 pieces)
   - Go to `/history` - verify you only see User B's content
   - Verify User A's content is not visible

#### 3. Test Delete Security
1. **As User B**, try to delete User A's content:
   ```bash
   # Get User A's content ID from step 2
   curl -X DELETE "http://localhost:3001/api/history?id=USER_A_CONTENT_ID" \
        -H "Cookie: your-auth-cookie-for-user-b"
   ```
   - Should return success but not actually delete User A's content
   - Verify User A still has their content when they sign back in

#### 4. Test Database Level Isolation
1. Check that all queries include `user_id` filter:
   - ✅ History API: `eq('user_id', user.id)` 
   - ✅ Delete API: `eq('user_id', user.id)`
   - ✅ Transform API: `user_id: user.id` in inserts

### Expected Results
- ✅ Unauthenticated requests return 401
- ✅ Users only see their own content in library
- ✅ Users cannot delete other users' content
- ✅ All database operations are scoped to authenticated user
- ✅ No data leakage between users

### Security Features Implemented
1. **Authentication Required**: All API routes verify user authentication
2. **Database Row Level Security**: All queries filtered by `user_id`
3. **API Route Security**: Server-side authentication with secure headers
4. **Frontend Security**: Client-side authentication checks
5. **Delete Protection**: Users can only delete their own content

### Files Modified
- `src/app/api/history/route.ts` - New secure API route
- `src/app/history/page.tsx` - Updated to use secure API
- `src/app/api/transform/route.ts` - Already had user isolation
- `src/app/api/usage/route.ts` - Already had user isolation
